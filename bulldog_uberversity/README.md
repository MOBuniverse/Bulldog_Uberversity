# bulldog_uberversity

A new Flutter project.
We wanted to create a ride-share-inspired app providing students with a safe mode of transportation, food order/delivery, socialization, and location-based information and directions. Bulldog Uberverity introduces a new way for students to interact within and outside the campus. It aims not only to assist students who don’t have access to a car but also to help students who do have a car obtain a little extra money if they become a driver. When looking for ways of transportation, food delivery, etc., students can look to their student body for assistance rather than outsiders. There was an incident about a year ago where an “Uber driver” tried to abduct two female students from Patton Hall. Our app would alleviate some of the stressors and dangers of regular ride-share companies by creating a database of university-known drivers and riders. My group believes this project will enhance the student experience and serve as a comprehensive digital hub for everything related to Alabama A&M University reducing stress and anxiety by introducing students briefly. It is a great situation for both parties. Students will be given payment base fare for pickup, drop-off, per-mile, and per-minute fees. Drivers will also get 100% of customer tips. Student passengers will feel more comfortable with a peer taking the combination of Firebase and various development tools will ensure a robust, scalable, and user-friendly mobile app for current students.
